# Chest-Clinic-Graphical-Model

## Project Summary
*** We made exact inferences about probabilistic graphical models using the state-of-the-art graphical model packages in R programming languages using gRain and Rgraphviz libraries from Bioconductor. Model was based on the Asia Chest Clinic model for Tuberculosis diagnosis for a person who has travelled to Asia and returned back with some symtomps.
